Primary care payment fixes... a bridge too short for a river too wide?

Primary care has been ideally conceptualized as accessible, timely, first-contact care that is comprehensive, coordinated, and longitudinal.1 Primary care in the US, however, falls far short of these goals, which many blame on a payment system that underpays for comprehensive services provided by primary care practitioners (PCPs) and fails to provide adequate compensation for non-visit based services that delivery of primary care requires. As a consequence, current reimbursement of primary care fails to adequately pay for actual services provided.2 In addition, few medical students choose primary care which, along with the retirement of older PCPs, will soon result in an insufficient workforce to care for an aging population.3 To counter these trends, explicit strategies to increase the amount of total health care spending devoted to primary care are being proposed4 (with states targeting spending of 7% to 12% of total healthcare expenditures on primary care) 5 Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized important changes to PCP reimbursement in the Physician Fee Schedule (to begin in 2021) wherein primary care fee-for-service per-visit payments were increased, and documentation requirements decreased for Medicare patients.6
