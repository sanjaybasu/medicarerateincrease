Primary care (PC) has been ideally conceptualized as accessible, timely, first-contact care that is comprehensive, coordinated, and longitudinal.1 Primary care in the US, however, falls far short of these goals, which many blame on a payment system that underpays for cognitive services provided by primary care practitioners (PCPs) and does not generate the revenue sufficient to provide necessary services. As a consequence, the small number medical students choosing primary care and the retirement of older PCPs is combining to create a primary care workforce shortage. To counter these trends, primary care spending increases are being proposed to improve payment for primary care services, with the intention of improving population health, reducing emergency department and hospital utilization, and reducing overall medical spending.2 For instance, Rhode Island and Oregon have increased PC spending, and the governor of Massachusetts recently proposed substantially increase spending on PC and behavioral health.  Most recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized important changes to PCP reimbursement (to begin in 2021) wherein primary care fee-for-service per-visit payments were increased, and documentation requirements decreased for Medicare patients.3 We sought to determine whether, and to what degree, the proposed rule changes by CMS will approach levels of spending likely to improve population health and lower overall costs.2 Through this new rule, and further, to estimate the rule’s implications for time use in primary care practices based on changes in documentation requirements.
